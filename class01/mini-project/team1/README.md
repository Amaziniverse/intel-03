# Face Blur System for Privacy Protection

This project was created for privacy protection. 

During real-time video recording, there is a frequent occurrence of privacy invasion when other individuals are inadvertently captured, compromising personal privacy. Additionally, manually blurring the faces of other people in the editing process is not an easy task. So we developed a system using the OpenVINO AI model to automatically detect and recognize human faces, enabling the application of blur processing.
